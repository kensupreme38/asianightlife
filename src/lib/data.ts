By now you'll realize that many KTVs are located in Q5 due to their proximity to Chinatown. We saw some really hot videos online. If its your first time at a vietnamese KTV, remember to ask for the strip dance. It's quite the experience.There are some pretty hostesses here, but we'd say only about 10-15% of them. The others are run-of-the-mill and nothing really stands out. You might get hotter girls at larger KTVs like Boss and Catwalk. The upside is you get really good prices here and won't burn a hole in your pocket.",
