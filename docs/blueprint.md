## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Sky blue (#87CEEB), evoking a sense of calmness and reliability, essential for a development tool.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0), providing a neutral backdrop that doesn't distract from the code.
- Accent color: Teal (#008080), used sparingly to highlight interactive elements and calls to action, adding a touch of sophistication.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif with a modern, machined, objective, neutral look. Suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' monospaced font for clear code presentation.
- Use simple, outlined icons for file types, actions, and navigation. The style should be modern and unobtrusive.
- Subtle transitions for file loading, saving, and UI interactions to provide smooth feedback without being distracting.
